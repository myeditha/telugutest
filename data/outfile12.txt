    10% Quota In Jobs For Economically Weak In Upper Castes Cleared: Sources    The government today clear 10 per cent reservation in government jobs for economically weaker sections from upper castes     All India | Edited by Deepshikha Ghosh | Updated: January 07, 2019 14:56 IST                      10% reservation in government jobs for economically weaker sections from upper castes cleared         NEW DELHI:    The centre will move a constitutional amendment to enable 10 per cent reservation in government jobs and education for economically weaker upper castes, in a mega decision that comes just months before the national election.    A constitutional amendment bill is likely to be moved tomorrow.    Sources say the cabinet has approved the move for such a quota in direct recruitment and for admission in higher educational institutions. The decision, say sources, is in line with the view of its ideological mentor RSS or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) that reservation should be along economic lines and not just based on caste.    COMMENT    The government's big move comes at a time the ruling BJP is seen by many to have lost its invincibility after its election defeats to the Congress in three major heartland states.    https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/10-per-cent-reservation-in-government-jobs-for-economically-weaker-sections-from-upper-castes-cleare-1973820?pfrom=home-topscroll    @uttermost

     Real estate is very local. Varies from place to place. Good schools, safety,proximity to transit hubs etc. in general are the drivers. If some of these factors apply, then prices may not fluctuate as much as other places.    Depending upon your area do some research on zillow or other sites and see how the prices have fared last few months. I think they also do some future predictions.    As far as immigration situation, it is really a personal call. Good luck!

   KCR has a track record of getting elected to the Lok Sabha on three earlier occasions. He had represented Karimnagar, Mahbubnagar and Medak. He had got elected from Karimnagar for the first time in 2004 and in the subsequent two by-elections in 2006 and 2008.    In 2014, he had contested from the     Medak Lok Sabha constituency    apart from the Gajwel assembly segment. He retained Gajwel and quit his LS seat. KCR bagged 6,57,492 votes to win the Medak seat in 2014. K Prabhakar Reddy won it with a lesser majority, getting 5,71,800 votes in the bypoll the same year as TRS candidate.    According to TRS sources, KCR is chalking out a plan to better the record of TRS in LS polls. Out of the 17 seats, he had asked partymen to work hard to make sure TRS candidates bag the 16 LS seats. TRS has an understanding with MIM for the Hyderabad seat, which will be left for Asaduddin Owaisi.    KCR contesting from Medak LS constituency again would make it a safe bet but while campaigning during the 2018 assembly polls, he announced at a public meeting that the incumbent K Prabhakar Reddy would be renominated and urged voters to elect him again with a big majority. Another seat that TRS can take for granted is the Karimnagar seat. Party working president KT Rama Rao had announced that B Vinod Kumar would be renominated from here.

     agree kani I am judging by what they say and I see rather than make up something from some gossip fake news maker like ABN....KCR's respect for Sonia is still same but his hatred for Congress is well documented because of their modus operandi..now he is in position he can do whatever and care little about congress. My point is just to highlight how screwed up Congress tier-2 leaders are --absolutely clueless MFers..look at that Kuntia who is the current incharge. Unless they bring in new blood they will disappear and/or be dependent of coalition politics forever.    naku digvijay singh and jairam ramesh paina chala nammakamu unnadi for all these screw ups.    I will be glad  even if it is KCR trade mark politics for calling off congress merger..either way I am a happy camper that the merger didn't happen..screw congress

        Kaushik Basu, who is a well-known economist from India who also worked as the Chief Economist at the World Bank, heaped praises on Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for his vision and foresight which have brought global recognition to the state.    "You have a man with vision and the who is one of the most dynamic leaders of India. His dynamism has an effect over people from this state. In fact, the global presence of Andhra people and their work culture is talked about. He is responsible for showing them the way," he said, speaking at the Indian Economists Association forum.    Pointing out that Telugu is the second most spoken language in a party of New York after English, this is Chandrababu's effect. "It is very rare for a politician to be interested in economic ideas. There were only two politicians who wanted to discuss economic reforms during his previous tenure. One of them was Chandrababu Naidu and the other was Nitish Kumar," he said, sharing his experience of being Chief Economic Advisor to the Government of India.   The video of Kaushik Basu's words for AP Chief Minister has gone viral and Chandrababu's supporters are upbeat about the economist's words. Netizens who are the TDP Chief's supporters and followers have been listing out his development works, in support of Basu's words.

   Sreedharan happy with Hyderabad Metro Rail works     Hyderabad : Dr E Sreedharan, who is considered the father of Metro Rail revolution and Metro Man of India, visited Metro Rail Bhavan in Hyderabad on Thursday and discussed the progress of Hyderabad Metro Rail project with HMRL MD NVS Reddy.     Feeling nostalgic about how he groomed NVS Reddy as a young officer in Konkan Railway and how initially the Detailed Project Report (DPR) was prepared for only two Metro Rail corridors in Hyderabad, Dr Sreedharan stated that he was very happy that the Hyderabad Metro Rail project is getting ready for inauguration soon.    Explaining the inclusion of the third corridor, the additions made to the original two corridors and how the project was brought to the present shape through sheer determination, perseverance and tactful handling of several sensitive issues, NVS Reddy expressed his gratitude to Dr Sreedharan for his rigorous training and grooming as a young officer in the tough Konkan Railway environment in the late 1980s.     
   MD, HMRL Mr NVS Reddy and the Military Chief of Telangana &amp; Andhra Sub-Area (GOC) Major General Mr N Srinivas Rao inspected the Sainik Aramghar works being executed by HMRL on Old Gandhi Hospital premises in Secunderabad

   The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy in India plans to add yet another record-breaking project in its portfolio and it has chosen the district of Anantapur in the state of Andhra Pradesh where it plans the world‚Äôs largest solar-wind hybrid project.    The mega project will have a capacity of 160 megawatts and would be built over a land area of 1000 acres. The project is expected to entail an investment of approximately INR 1000 crores ($155 million). The World Bank has agreed to provide funding for the project.     This hybrid solar wind project will be jointly developed by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), the renewable energy agency of Andhra Pradesh, NREDCAP, and Andhra Pradesh Transco.    The project is expected to have 120 megawatts of solar power and 40 megawatts of wind energy capacity installed and will be equipped with a battery storage system to ensure it remains operational even during nighttime when there is no sun and decline in wind speed. SECI had initiated plans to implement storage capacity at solar power parks but could not implement those plans due to a variety of reasons.    The fact that the World Bank has agreed to fund the project means that the tariffs would likely be extremely competitive, even with the existing thermal power plants in the country. The World Bank had offered debt funding for a 750 megawatt solar power park in the state of Madhya Pradesh earlier this year. The auction for that solar park broke the record for the lowest solar power tariff in the country at that time.    Andhra Pradesh has faced problems of grid failure and power fluctuations and hence it is looking at means of incorporating energy storage to alleviate grid power management problems coming from intermittent renewable energy projects.      This project is being promoted on a pilot scale project and the idea is to create a model where grid failures can be totally avoided. Similar types of hybrid projects have been tried and tested in Jamaica and China, however, this project will be largest, when commissioned.    The Andhra Pradesh government has committed to 10 GW of solar by 2022 and 8 GW of wind. Of this, there are plans for 3GW of hybrid wind and solar plants.
