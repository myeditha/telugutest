          India name squads for Australia tour               A few surprises in the squads India have named for their upcoming Test and Twenty20 series' against Australia    India have named a strong 18-player squad for their Test series against Australia this summer, while former captain MS Dhoni will not be seen during the Twenty20 series against the Aussies.    Experienced batter Rohit Sharma has won a recall to the Test squad after he was overlooked for the recent series against the West Indies, while there is no room for Shikhar Dhawan, Gautam Gambhir and Suresh Raina.    Instead, India will rely on exciting teenager Prithvi Shaw at the top of their batting order, with Murali Vijay, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane expected to provide the support to in-form skipper Virat Kohli.    There were few surprises in the bowlers India selected, with experienced spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja selected alongside slow left-armer Kuldeep Yadav.    Umesh Yadav headlines a seam attack that includes Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah.    Kohli was named captain for the three-game T20 series against Australia, with Rohit selected as his vice-captain.    There was no room for Dhoni, however, who will sit out T20 series' against both the West Indies and Australia during November.    The experienced Dhoni retired from Test cricket following the Boxing Day Test against Australia in 2014, but has featured consistently for India in one-day and T20 cricket ever since.    MSK Prasad didn't rule out a return for Dhoni in future, with India's chief selector claiming "it is not the end of Dhoni in T20Is".    Australia will play four Test matches against India, with the first five-day contest commencing in Adelaide on Thursday December 6.    The two nations will first contest three Twenty20 matches, with the Gabba in Brisbane hosting the opening game on Wednesday November 21.    India Test squad: Virat Kohli (C), M Vijay, KL Rahul, Prithvi Shaw, Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Hanuma Vihari, Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Parthiv Patel, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar    India Twenty20 squad: Virat Kohli (C), Rohit Sharma (vc), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, Rishabh Pant (wk), Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Washington Sundar, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Umesh Yadav, Khaleel Ahmed

   Nov 29 Deeksha Diwas – Historic day in Telangana statehood struggle     
   vedu stage meda emo kani bayata chala manchodu     
   Phoenix police on Saturday were investigating reports of a sexual assault after a woman who has been hospitalized in a vegetative state for the past decade gave birth.    The woman, who was incapacitated in a drowning incident, was a patient at Hacienda Healthcare when she went into labour on December 29 and delivered a baby boy, according to local media.         No one knew she was pregnant and the healthcare staff were initially unsure why she was moaning, the reports said.    “This matter is currently under investigation by the Phoenix Police Department,” Sergeant Tommy Thompson told Reuters when asked about the media reports.    Hacienda spokesman David Leibowitz said the facility had recently become aware of a “deeply disturbing incident” involving one of its residents.    He declined to say whether its staff were being asked to undergo DNA testing to identify a possible suspect, or whether the facility was taking any preventative measures to protect patients against a similar situation.    “While federal and state privacy laws prohibit us from publicly discussing a patient’s health or case, Hacienda has and will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement and all the relevant regulatory agencies regarding this matter,” Leibowitz said by email.    Victim advocate Tasha Menaker, chief strategy officer of the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, said it would be appropriate for police to run DNA tests on male employees at the facility.    Hacienda HealthCare describes itself as Arizona’s leading provider of specialized health care services for medically fragile and chronically ill infants, children, teens, and young adults as well as those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.    A spokesman for Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said the reports were “deeply troubling” and that the state was re-evaluating its contract and regulatory authority over Hacienda Healthcare to tighten up patient safety measures.

   2014 : @ 4:00               2018 @8:30               his regard for sonia gandhi was always great and it was same in 2014 and 2018 but congress leaders made enough damage to themselves for KCR not to merge TRS into Congress post bifurcation.    First it was mishandling of Jagan post YSR death and in 2014 when KCR offered to merge his party for Pradesh Congress chief post but DigVijay Singh mocked and turned him down.    Kudos to Jayram Ramesh and Digvijay Singh for shafting ROD into pradesh congress once and for all.

   Randu  sarlu  travel chesa. If your final destination is Reykjavik  then go for it. If you are connecting to any other country from Reykjavik, keep in mind that there are no codeshare agreements for wow air. In case you miss your connection  there is a very good chance that you are stranded in the airport for one day. This happened to me in 2016. I had schengen back then so I was safe to enter the country.     Otherwise it's like any other budget airline. Cramped seats, less than helpful ground staff, no food or water for free and no free baggage.

   Singapore varsity ranks Andhra Pradesh No 1 in Ease of Doing Business, Maharashtra 2nd      The Singapore institute also suggested areas where improvement was needed in the state. The report mentioned that despite Andhra Pradesh's excellent performance in ACI's EDB Index, the government needs to bridge numerous institutional and infrastructural gaps in order to sustain its position in the future.              Ashish Pandey    Hyderabad   January 3, 2019   UPDATED: January 3, 2019 23:05 IST                                            Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu. (File Photo: PTI)      HIGHLIGHTS     International investors look for a stable government and leadership: CM   We have to reach the expectations of foreign investors: CM   Andhra Pradesh needs 14 million smartphones meant for distribution for ease of living              Andhra Pradesh has topped the Ease of Doing Business (EDB) list compiled by a team of researchers led by Tan Khee Giap, who is the co-director of Asia competitiveness institute (ACI), and associate professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.    Andhra is followed by Maharashtra and Delhi.         In the latest ranking of Asia Competitiveness Institute's (ACI) EDB index, Andhra Pradesh bagged the top rank in 2018.    Expressing delight over the announcement, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said, "International investors look for a stable government with strong policies before coming forward for investments. The state government would take into consideration the observations including weaknesses and try to strengthen those areas."    The chief minister also announced that his government was planning to distribute smartphones to each family for ease of living.    "Nearly 14 million smartphones should be manufactured for distribution in the state," Naidu said.    The Singapore institute also suggested areas where improvement was needed in the state. The report mentioned that despite Andhra Pradesh's excellent performance in ACI's EDB Index, the government needs to bridge numerous institutional and infrastructural gaps in order to sustain its position in the future.    The ACI team highlighted that there was sufficient room for improvement in sub environments such as facilitating business operations, infrastructure resilience and market potential.    Worker density, foreign direct investment per capital, labour productivity, and illiteracy rate were identified as the weakest indicators for the state among others.    The ACI team also emphasised that an analysis at the indicator level will help identify specific areas of improvement and will play a crucial role in making Andhra Pradesh the best investment destination by 2050.    Asia Competitiveness Institute at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore was established as a research centre in 2006 with an aim to build intellectual leadership and network for understanding and developing competitiveness in the Asia region.         https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/andhra-pradesh-ranks-1-in-ease-of-doing-business-maharashtra-second-1423040-2019-01-03

   RCB sell de Kock to Mumbai in IPL 2019's first trade             South African wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock is the IPL's first trade of 2019, before the auction takes place in mid-December. ESPNcricinfo understands that de Kock, who last year played for Royal Challengers Bangalore, has been traded to Mumbai Indians in an all-money deal.    Royal Challengers had bought de Kock for INR 2.8 crore (USD 437,000) at the 2018 auction. ESPNcricinfo has learnt that Mumbai have bought de Kock at that price and to offset the deal, they have released Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman (INR 2.2 crore, USD 343,000) and Sri Lankan offspinner Akila Dananjaya (INR 50 lakh, USD 78,000).    De Kock played eight matches in IPL 2018, scoring 201 runs at a strike rate of 124.07. Although Mumbai already have two wicketkeepers in Ishan Kishan and Aditya Tare, they might have been keen on de Kock for his top-order batting. They used the hard-hitting West Indies batsman Evin Lewis as opener earlier this year, but he struggled towards the end of the season, prompting the Mumbai coaching staff to seek back-ups. De Kock, who has also played for Delhi Daredevils and Sunrisers Hyderabad, has impressive numbers in the IPL, scoring a hundred and six fifties in 34 innings. He has also made 573 of his 927 runs in the Powerplay, at a strike-rate of 125.6.    The IPL has two main trading windows with the first one starting immediately at the end of the season stretching to a month before the auction and the second one from after the auction till the start of the tournament. Since 2018, the IPL also introduced a mid-tournament window for franchises to trade uncapped players and players who had not played more than two matches.    With the last date for retentions and release being November 15, franchises are busy working out their plans for the new season before they make fresh buys at the auction. A purse of INR 3 crore will be available for the franchises in addition to the balance left after last year's auction.    The IPL has not yet formally communicated an auction date, but ESPNcricinfo understands December 16 has been earmarked with Goa as the likely venue. The franchises were told that the auction was supposed to happen between December 15 and 20.    The franchises will also want clarity over where the IPL will take place in 2019 because India's general elections will be taking place around the same time as the tournament. This had been the case in 2014 as well when, owing to security concerns, the first set of matches were played in the UAE.    Now, however, the franchises are averse to playing in the Dubai and Abu Dhabi because they fear the pitches would end up being too slow. The IPL has not revealed any plans yet, but it is understood that South Africa has been chalked in as an alternative venue. It is also waiting for the central election commission to announce the date for the elections, but franchises want an answer soon so they can prepare for the auction accordingly.

     A major of irrigational dams and projects were designed and developed by the British before they left. Many were completed just after Inddependence.    Polavaram was started in 1960s and nobody could finish at least 10% of the whole work.    Lets not forget the Interlinking of rivers project envisioned by the Great British Empire before 1947, which fake leaders like CBN will never ever understand it.

   01/01/2019: H-1B Cap Pre-Registration Proposed Rule w/558 Comments Received as of 12/31/2018     The comment period will end at the end of the day of tomorrow, 01/02/2019. The total comments which OIRA received was 558 as of yesterday. It thus appears that the total number of comments may not exceed 650 in toto. Let's see how quickly the USCIS could complete review of comments to finalize the rule-making process as quickly as possible. Immigration stakeholders, including the AILA, endeavor to delay implementation of this pre-registration rule after the FY 2020 H-1B Cap Season.     source : immigration-law.com

         Mahesh Babu's new look from Maharshi is out on the New Year's eve. Mahesh looks his stylish best in the new poster that is sure to get the thumbs up from everyone.    First poster of Maharshi revealed the bearded look of Mahesh and this poster shows him as the stylish entrepreneur with a hint of masala dose to it.    Director Vamsi Paidipalli is regarded as one of the stylish filmmakers of Telugu cinema and this poster reaffirms it.     Maharshi set for April release is produced by Aswini Dutt, Dil Raju and PVP.

     Where Fat Goes     Most of us really don’t think about where fat goes when we lose it. We’re just happy the scale says it’s gone. You may be curious to know fat doesn’t magically disappear after going through the fat burning process.           Research calculations show when fat is lost, 84 percent is exhaled as carbon dioxide. The remaining 16 percent is excreted as water. During the conversion of energy, carbon dioxide and water are byproducts or waste, according to Maloney. They are excreted via urine, perspiration, and exhalation.           Meerman provides an excellent graphic on everything you eat and where it all goes in his research. It is summarized below:                     148 ounces in       148 ounces out     23oz. oxygen   metabolized into   27oz. carbon dioxide     15oz. food       1oz. urine solids             10oz. metabolic water                   110oz. water   unchanged   110oz. water     food moisture       urine     beverages       exhaled vapor     plain water       sweat             feces        What You Eat and Where it Goes           The research also reveals the lungs as the primary organ used to remove fat from your body.

   Grieving Family Is Urging You to Take an Important Home Safety Step         Sixteen-month-old Bronwyn Taylor had only been left alone for a few moments. Sadly, that was all the time it took for tragedy to strike. Within seconds, Bronwyn tangled herself in the cord from the her grandparents' window blinds, and it wrapped around her neck. By the time her grandmother found her, she was unconscious. Paramedics were called and Bronwyn, who was in cardiac arrest by that time, was rushed to the nearby hospital, but it was too late - she did not survive.    Her parents Matthew and Cathy Taylor, telling their tragic tale to spread awareness about the dangers of basic household objects. "We also advise shades with accessible cords be replaced by cordless window coverings."
