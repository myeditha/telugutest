           In 2018, 16 percent of Americans said that they would like to move to another country, according to a Gallup poll released Friday.    Since Trump took office, 20 percent of women would like to leave, compared with 13 percent of men.    Age is an additional factor, with 30 percent of 15- to 29-year-olds wanting to get out. That number drops significantly with age to 19 percent of 30- to 49-year-olds and 8 percent of people 50 and older. Furthermore, those with lower incomes were more inclined to say they’d like to leave, too.    So where would all the expats go? Canada is one option. Following the 2016 election, that was a common fantasy for the disillusioned and angry, and by 2018, more than 1 in 4 Americans indicated a desire to go to Canada, Gallup stats show. That’s more than double the number who named Canada as an ideal destination in 2016.

    Trivikram Lifts Story Idea From Hollywood, Again!     January 04 , 2019 | UPDATED 20:31 IST               According to the grapevine, Trivikram, who is currently busy in developing the script for Allu Arjun's film, has lifted the basic idea from a Hollywood film.    If the buzz is to be believed, Trivikram has inspired from a Hollywood film titled The Invention of Lying a 2009 Hollywood movie.    Earlier Trivikram received flak for lifting the plot of French film Largo Winch for Agnyathavasi.    He was also criticized for not crediting either Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani or Vijaya Nirmala for A Aa. Looks like the star writer has run out of ideas and been looking elsewhere for inspiration.    Allu Arjun reportedly asked for a light entertainer like Nuvvu Naaku Nachav and apparently Trivikram is using his writing skills to make The Invention of Lying appeal to Telugu viewers.    Trivikram's plot is reportedly based on father-son relationship where the son had to resort to telling lies for the sake of his father.      
   Mumbai: Several villages from Nanded district in Maharashtra have expressed desire to become part of neighbouring Telangana claiming "neglect" by successive governments of their home state for the "last 70 years".  The villages have claimed that they are deprived of even basic amenities like roads and water.  Baburao Kadam, a sarpanch of one of the villages in Dharmabad tehsil in Nanded, located 575 kms away from Mumbai, today visited Telangana's Nizamabad district and handed over a proposal of their demand to local TRS MLA Bajireddy Govardhan.    When contacted, Nanded district Guardian Minister Ramdas Kadam said he would first look into the details before commenting on the issue.  Baburao Kadam said, "There are some 40 villages out of 55 in Dharmabad tehsil of Nanded district that have been neglected for years. No state government in last 70 years has helped us or provided any infrastructure. Hence, we submitted our proposal for induction in Telangana to the TRS MLA".

     Its pretty simple dude:  X group of people  Yesterday some feared and sold apple..... and Then there is other group of people Y thinks apple is cheap now lets buy it...    So the market news makes  X, Y group to buy or sell. Today news job market, Fed says it  may adjust Fed interest rates.. which is good sign for market..so  some people from X grp and some people from Y grp bought stocks  and there by market moved up..    if some news comes again.. which sense not good for market then X and y group may sell.... its based on many reasons.

   US national debt has grown by $2 trillion since Trump took office         Despite campaigning on a promise to "eliminate waste, fraud and abuse" in government, the national debt is more than $2 trillion higher at the start of his third year in office than when Trump was inaugurated. The deficit is set to hit $1 trillion by 2020.

   Why daily phone call to your parent is important?    My father calls me every day at around 9 pm.    One fine day, just for a change, I called him a bit earlier at around 8:30 pm.    Mom took the call and we talked for few minutes. Then I asked:         Me: Where is Dad?    Mom: He has just returned from office and is getting fresh. Wait. I am calling him.     Me: No, he must be hungry then. You both have your dinner first, then I will call you again after an hour.    Mom: No, He never eats before talking to you all.         I couldn't reply for few seconds.  I was amazed. This is their love towards me.    Sometimes, all what our parents need is to listen to our voices. We can never understand how lonely they feel without us. They have to celebrate most of the festivals without us. Our presence is the only thing which can make them happy. But, we are not there with them (because of various reasons). It makes them sad but they don't make us realise that.         So, this is the least possible thing we can do to make them happy.          For all my friends who stay away from their parents in another city because of job/studies Talk to them daily (And don't wait for them to call us every time. Sometimes, you can also call and feel that happiness in their voices)    Agree?

   రెండు తెలుగు రాష్ట్రాల్లో తెలంగాణలో ఎన్నికల వేడి పూర్తయింది. ఇప్పుడు ఆంధ్రప్రదేశ్ లో ఎన్నికల వేడి మొదలయింది. ఇంకా ఎన్నికలకు మూడు నుండి నాలుగు నెలలు గడువు ఉన్నాకూడా అప్పుడే హడావుడి మొదలయింది.  ఇప్పటికే YSRCP అధ్యక్షుడు సుదీర్ఘ పాదయాత్ర ముగింపు దశకు చేరుతుండగా ఆయన ఎన్నికలపై పూర్తిస్థాయి దృష్టి సారిస్తున్నారు.  ముఖ్యమంత్రి చంద్రబాబు కూడ తెలంగాణ ఎన్నికలలో ప్రచారం చేసి ఫలితాలపై నిరాశ చెందినప్పటికి ఆంధ్రప్రదేశ్ లో తన పాలన పై శ్వేత పత్రాలు విడుదల చేస్తూ ఎన్నికల ప్రచారం మొదలు పెట్టేసినట్టే అని చెప్పాలి.  “జంప్” మొదలు  ఎన్నికలు మొదలు అవుతున్నాయి అనగానే పార్టీలలో జంప్ లు సర్వసాధారణం. కాని ఎన్నికలకు ముందే ఆంధ్ర లో జంప్ లు మొదలయ్యాయి. TDP పార్టీ సభ్యత్వానికి రాజీనామా చేస్తున్నట్లు అనంతపురం జిల్లాకు చెందిన మాజీ MLA , సీనియర్ నేత గుర్నాధ్ రెడ్డి TDPకి రాజీనామా చేశారు. ఆయన YSRCP లో చేరే ఛాన్స్ ఉన్నట్లు తెలుస్తుంది. ఆయన మొదట కాంగ్రెస్ లో ఉండగా జగన్ YSRCP పార్టీ పెట్టినప్పటి నుండి ఆయన వెంటే ఉన్నారు. తర్వాత ఉప ఎన్నికలలో కూడా గెలిచారు. కాని 2014 లో YSRCP తరపున MLA గా పోటీ చేసి ఓడిపోయారు. JC దివాకర్ రెడ్డి సహాయంతో TDP లో చేరారు. “చంద్రబాబు ప్రత్యేక హోదాపై వైఖరికి, ఆయన పాలనకు వ్యతిరేకంగా TDPకి రాజీనామా చేస్తున్నట్లు ప్రకటించారు”.         https://prajaavani.com/andhra-pradesh/jump-started/?fbclid=IwAR1oCMX6bq8hiYXDOHmbIBDpBX4QOrQDZN3vEe6Xp6y_zvppxBwzdtXX4vU

       The ₹8,300-cr. project is being taken up in PPP mode, may start operation by Dec. 2023, says official     Foundation for the ₹8,300 crore Visakhapatnam Metro Rail project to be taken up in public private partnership (PPP) is likely to be laid in February with a view to start operations by December 2023, according to Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development, Karikal Valaven.    He was speaking at a high-level meeting on the Metro project at the VMRDA Office on Wednesday.    ‘No land problem’    Mr. Valavan said it was the biggest metro rail project being taken up under the PPP. The Principal Secretary and N.P. Ramakrishna Reddy, Managing Director of Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation, made a presentation on the project to MP K. Haribabu, Government Whip P.G.V.R. Naidu and MLAs P. Vishnu Kumar Raju and Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar.    Mr. Reddy said 92.4 % of the land required was that of the government and hence there was no problem. Permission from the Railways was given and No Objection Certificate from the National Highways Authority of India was awaited. Two depots were proposed for Metro Rail and for one Visakhapatnam Port Trust was allotting land for one depot near the airport. For the other one at Hanumanthavaka, revenue officials were approached.    District Collector Pravin Kumar, Metropolitan Commissioner P. Basanth Kumar and Municipal Commissioner M. Hari Narayanan participated in the deliberations.    Metro Rail is designed on three corridors running for a length of 42.55 km.    Of the cost, ₹ 4,200 crore required for civil infrastructure will be invested by the State government by obtaining a loan from the Korean government besides operations’ support for 10 years to make up for rider-ship shortfall. The non-civil infrastructure cost of ₹ 4,100 crore has to be invested by the private developer.    The government has decided to allow 250 acres of government land free of cost to AMRC for repayment of loan that will finally come to ₹6,500 crore in 20 years.    Separate tenders    AMRC will call for separate tenders for development of commercial and residential properties, malls and IT SEZs to earn revenue for the repayment of the loan.    As per the new Metro Policy, the Union government gives a grant of 10 % of the investment being made by the State government.    Request for Proposals have been issued to Shapoorji Pallomji, Adani Private Limited, TRIL Urban Transport Private Limited, ESSEL Infra Limited and IL & FS Rail Limited and the last date for receiving the bid documents is January 21.    Mr. Haribabu assured his support to the project as per the New Metro Policy under which 10 % of the State government investment would be footed by the Union government, it was learnt.    Mr. Vishnu Kumar Raju wanted the Metro Rail extended up to Anandapuram in view of the location of engineering colleges and government housing coming up at Kommadi and Madhurawada. The Collector asked the MD to consider it in view of the Greenfield airport proposed and the six-lane highway coming up.

    Every Software Engineer in the US who graduated from united AP is a benefactor of CBN's vision and implementation.     CBN realized the importance of CS engineering early and boosted more educational institutions to offer MCA, B. Tech, M. Tech. and BCA.     He built IIIT and ISB in Hyd. to support advanced degrees.     It's a different topic that YSR just exploited all the above with free education and started producing useless graduates.

   Sreedharan happy with Hyderabad Metro Rail works     Hyderabad : Dr E Sreedharan, who is considered the father of Metro Rail revolution and Metro Man of India, visited Metro Rail Bhavan in Hyderabad on Thursday and discussed the progress of Hyderabad Metro Rail project with HMRL MD NVS Reddy.     Feeling nostalgic about how he groomed NVS Reddy as a young officer in Konkan Railway and how initially the Detailed Project Report (DPR) was prepared for only two Metro Rail corridors in Hyderabad, Dr Sreedharan stated that he was very happy that the Hyderabad Metro Rail project is getting ready for inauguration soon.    Explaining the inclusion of the third corridor, the additions made to the original two corridors and how the project was brought to the present shape through sheer determination, perseverance and tactful handling of several sensitive issues, NVS Reddy expressed his gratitude to Dr Sreedharan for his rigorous training and grooming as a young officer in the tough Konkan Railway environment in the late 1980s.

   The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy in India plans to add yet another record-breaking project in its portfolio and it has chosen the district of Anantapur in the state of Andhra Pradesh where it plans the world’s largest solar-wind hybrid project.    The mega project will have a capacity of 160 megawatts and would be built over a land area of 1000 acres. The project is expected to entail an investment of approximately INR 1000 crores ($155 million). The World Bank has agreed to provide funding for the project.     This hybrid solar wind project will be jointly developed by Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), the renewable energy agency of Andhra Pradesh, NREDCAP, and Andhra Pradesh Transco.    The project is expected to have 120 megawatts of solar power and 40 megawatts of wind energy capacity installed and will be equipped with a battery storage system to ensure it remains operational even during nighttime when there is no sun and decline in wind speed. SECI had initiated plans to implement storage capacity at solar power parks but could not implement those plans due to a variety of reasons.    The fact that the World Bank has agreed to fund the project means that the tariffs would likely be extremely competitive, even with the existing thermal power plants in the country. The World Bank had offered debt funding for a 750 megawatt solar power park in the state of Madhya Pradesh earlier this year. The auction for that solar park broke the record for the lowest solar power tariff in the country at that time.    Andhra Pradesh has faced problems of grid failure and power fluctuations and hence it is looking at means of incorporating energy storage to alleviate grid power management problems coming from intermittent renewable energy projects.      This project is being promoted on a pilot scale project and the idea is to create a model where grid failures can be totally avoided. Similar types of hybrid projects have been tried and tested in Jamaica and China, however, this project will be largest, when commissioned.

   Grieving Family Is Urging You to Take an Important Home Safety Step         Sixteen-month-old Bronwyn Taylor had only been left alone for a few moments. Sadly, that was all the time it took for tragedy to strike. Within seconds, Bronwyn tangled herself in the cord from the her grandparents' window blinds, and it wrapped around her neck. By the time her grandmother found her, she was unconscious. Paramedics were called and Bronwyn, who was in cardiac arrest by that time, was rushed to the nearby hospital, but it was too late - she did not survive.    Her parents Matthew and Cathy Taylor, telling their tragic tale to spread awareness about the dangers of basic household objects. "We also advise shades with accessible cords be replaced by cordless window coverings."
