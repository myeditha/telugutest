     since your old one is gone in feb this year, and before that you already started new application so you are still in status as of now.    once this application get denied you will go into out of status immediately as you should leave country immediately. but some people say you have 10 days grace period which I don't think mentioned particular in any USCIS policy.    You should be ready with new employer to apply new h1b transfer immediately as soon as you hear about denial from second employer. and approval will depend on your luck and some times you get approval with out i94 since you went out of status of 2-3 weeks before you applied with 3 employer..

    January 7th, 2019 / 6:11 PM / Updated 2 hours ago          Image Source: Zee News      In order to cut costs and rationalise services, Prasar Bharati has decided to shut down All India Radio‚Äôs national channel and its regional training academies will be closed down by Public broadcaster Prasar Bharati in five cities.        View image on Twitter                       See GEORGE KALLIVAYALIL's other Tweets            Twitter Ads info and privacy                            According to an order issued by the Directorate General, All India Radio (AIR), the ministerial, technical, programme and other staff posted at AIR in Nagpur, Todapur and other places are likely to be posted according to the requirement of the organisation. The order also said that this would not include those who are working in five cities at Regional Academies of Broadcasting and Multimedia (RABMs), reported NDTV.     AIR to be shut down to cut costs    On December 24, 2018, Prasar Bharati had decided and communicated to DG AIR to close down the channel with immediate effect and close Regional Academies of Broadcasting and Multimedia located at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Shillong and Thiruvananthapuram to ‚Äúrationalise AIR services and keeping in view of the cost-cutting measures.‚Äù      Dated January 3, the order stated that the programmes of archival value that the national channel maintains have to be sent to Delhi‚Äôs central archives for digitization and preservation for successors. Naturally, certain sections within AIR itself are not pleased with the decision, as they believe that instead of shutting it down altogether, other methods to cut costs could have been thought about.    ‚ÄúThese days you can live stream, you can make it an application-based service, there are many other ways of cost-cutting. The effort should have been to strengthen national channel and not close it down,‚Äù a source said.    An AIR source said that the channel, which runs from 6 AM to 6 PM is one of the most popular national channels which kept people updated on social issues. It reaches almost 92% of the area of the country, according to AIR‚Äôs website. The largest network of radio in the world, it is also one of the world‚Äôs largest broadcasting organisations, serving a spectrum of socio-economic and cultural diversity.    AIR or officially known as Akash Vani since 1956 is a sister organisation of Doordarshan and was launched in 1936. The first ever FM service was started in Madras (Chennai) in the year 1977. Rajni S K Dutta, a presenter who made the first announcement on May 18, 1988, told Economic Times, ‚ÄúIt was primarily intended for students and those who worked night shifts.‚Äù With the closure of AIR, it is truly an end of an era.

   Cabinet approves 10 per cent reservation for economically backward among general category     This reservation will be over and above the existing 50 per cent reservation, they said.    NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet has approved 10 per cent reservation in jobs and educational institutions for the economically backward section in the general category, sources said Monday.    The government is likely to bring a constitutional amendment bill in Parliament on Tuesday, they said, adding that the quota will be over and above the existing 50 per cent reservation. The section doesn't get reservation as of now, the sources said.      "The reservation will be given to those economically backward poor people who are not availing the benefit of reservation as of now," a source explained.              The reservation benefit is likely to be availed by those whose annual income is below Rs 8 lakh and have up to five acres of land, he said.         Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution will have to be amended for implementation of the decision, the sources added.

        After winning the Telangana elections, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his family is buoyant of the role that the TRS chief can play in national politics. TRS MP Kavitha has stated that if Federal Front comes to power, then K. Chandrasekhar Rao may become the Prime Minister of India.    "It is already evident that KCR is succeeding in his efforts in creating the Federal Front. He has been successful in bringing together various regional parties and he will continue his efforts with Lok Sabha elections fast approaching," she said, adding that if Federal Front comes to power, the PM candidate will be decided by them.   Political observers, on the other hand, point out that the Telangana elections have given immense confidence to KCR's family. However, it is not just confidence but over-confidence they say. "While it looks like he is confident of making his efforts, it is difficult because he doesn't have the reach or relationship with various parties across India in the same way that his political rival Chandrababu has," a political analyst pointed out.   All in all, while both the Telugu States' Chief Ministers are trying to form different fronts, the race to the Lok Sabha elections has definitely got interesting!

   Actor Prakash Raj on Tuesday announced that he will be contesting in the 2019 general elections.        HIGHLIGHTS     Prakash Raj to contest as an independent candidate in Lok Sabha polls   Raj, known for his anti-BJP stance, made the announcement on Twitter   Actor likely to contest from Karnataka: Sources          ctor Prakash Raj announced on Tuesday that he will be contesting in the 2019 general elections. He will be contesting in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls as an independent candidate.    Sources close to Prakash Raj said he's likely to contest from Karnataka.         "Happy New Year to everyone...a new beginning...more responsibility...with your support I will be contesting in the coming parliament elections as an independent candidate. Details of the constituency soon. Ab ki baar Janatha ki Sarkar," the actor said on Twitter.    HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE..a new beginning .. more responsibility.. with UR support I will be contesting in the coming parliament elections as an INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE. Details of the constituency soon. Ab ki baar Janatha ki SARKAR #citizensvoice #justasking in parliament too..         Prakash Raj, who is known for his anti-BJP stance, is the third prominent actor after Rajinikanth and Kamal Hasan to enter politics in recent years.    He had earlier said that the kind of Hindutva that is propagated by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cannot work in India.    "They (BJP) say I'm anti-Hindu No. I am anti-Modi, I am anti-Hegde, I am anti-Amit Shah. And according to me, they're not Hindus," Raj said on January 2018.    Raj had earlier courted controversies for commenting on cow urine and cow dung. "You do not know about cows. You know about cow urine. If you want to wash your clothes, you need 1 kg cow dung and 2 litres of cow urine. You then need to mix all of this and wash your clothes. Why because, except for cow urine, you do not know anything else. So, do not give us this story," he said.    Raj's comments on cow dung and cow urine were not received well and an advocate in Bengaluru filed a complaint saying that the actor 'insulted the religious beliefs of Hindus, deliberately and intentionally, which hurt the emotions, feelings and sentiments'.    He was also trolled on social media for participating in a series of posts with #JustAsking where he questioned the BJP-led central government over several issues in India.    Raj had earlier claimed that Bollywood stopped offering him roles as he has been critical of the Modi government at the Centre.

   Discredited Volkswagen India representative cons Andhra Pradesh govt into investment scam      Eager to attract investments, the Andhra Pradesh Government gets trapped in a swindle thought up by a discredited India representative of a German car maker.       advertisement                    Amarnath K Menon   July 25, 2005    ISSUE DATE: July 25, 2005   UPDATED: April 12, 2012 13:05 IST                                          Walking into the Trap: Botsa Satyanarayana (left) with Helmuth Schuster  This is what some would call adventure capitalism. In the scramble to get Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car maker, to set up a Rs 5,800 crore plant close to the port city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh may have outwitted neighbours Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra but is paying a scandalous price for it.  As the car maker struggles to contain a sex and bribery scandal involving a number of senior executives in Europe, it is becoming clear that Volkswagen's former India representative Helmuth Schuster has, in connivance with some people, taken the Andhra Pradesh Government for a ride.  In less than a week in January this year, the persuasive Schuster asked for and got Euros 2 million (Rs 11 crore) of the proposed Euros 5 million from the state Government.  This was an instalment of its share of equity in a specially floated joint venture,VashishtaWahan, which is apparently intended to set up the car factory.  No sooner had the state received his letter on January 7, than Major Industries Minister Botsa Satyanarayana and mandarins in charge of welcoming industrial investments worked overtime to process the papers to send Schuster the money.  By January 12, the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation had released the money and the state's Finance Department had reimbursed the sum.    Volkswagen Car model  It is now clear that state officials failed to exercise due diligence about VashishtaWahan, which appears to be a fake avatar with the same acronym VW as the car maker. The registered address of the company in Delhi is, in fact, the office of a chartered accountant. Schuster floated VashishtaWahan with the help of his consultant Ashok Jain.  In the past three years, they travelled to several states, meeting the chief ministers and offering to start the car project. Those they met included former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Tamil Nadu's J. Jayalalithaa.  While Schuster was known as head, India Project Team, Volkswagen AG, Germany, Jain passed off as representative and chief adviser for Volkswagen Light Commercial Vehicle in India.  However, it was only after Schuster resigned last week following charges of "fraud and breach of trust" that the state rudely woke up to the fact that it had bitten a bribery bait. There are no deposit certificates for what it paid out as an investment in a joint venture.  Volkswagen, which is to retain 51 per cent of the equity, as indicated by Schuster, did not pay a single euro. Who withdrew the money is not known but Jain, who registered Vashishta Wahan, can no longer betraced to his official address.  The front company, set up with a share capital of justRs 1 lakh, was a benami operation and the state's money is all but lost.          "It is not as if Volkswagen company has vanished into thin air .... The money is very much safe." Y. S . Rajasekhara Reddy, Andhra Pradesh chief minister     "We were so desperate to get Volkswagen into Andhra Pradesh that we did everything short of touching the feet of the German company," admits Satyanarayana, who is back from a nine-day tour of Israel and UAE, where he and Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy were wooing investors.  Satyanarayana recalls that it was Girish Sanghi, a Congress MP and promoter of the Vaartha Group of newspapers in Hyderabad, who introduced Schuster, Jain and others associated with Vashishta Wahan to the state Government and pursued the project.  "We had no reason to suspect anyone. Naidu had rolled out the red carpet and hosted dinners for Schuster and Jain during his tenure," he says, while pointing out that Naidu had even made Jain a member of the Andhra Pradesh State Tourism Board in May 2003.  The state had little reason to suspect Schuster, for he was the personnel chief at Skoda, VW's Czech division, and chairman of the firm's pension fund. But wary officials, taking note of the cavalier style of Jain, called for caution.  The minister contends the money paid is not lost unless the state backs out or Volkswagen says it is not interested in setting up the factory. But there are few takers.  Reddy argues that the money is safe and, on the invitation of Volkswagen, the state would send a three man team to Germany to pursue the project. Since 2003 the state has been on an elusive chase.  The shrewd Naidu and his industries minister K. Vidyadhara Rao lured the VW team to Visakhapatnam in September. This came after they had looked at the prospects of setting up the plant in Tamil Nadu, where other auto majors Ford and Hyundai have a presence, and called on Jayalalithaa at Fort St George in March 2003. But the Schuster-Jain duo kept everyone guessing.  In trying to have a leg up on Naidu's aggressive sales pitch, the Congress Government pursued the matter with greater vigour. After Schuster's visit in January, an enthusiastic Satyanarayana announced that the car major had identified an Indian partner.          Conned For setting up a Volkswagen plant, the Andhra Pradesh Government paid Rs 11 crore as its share in a JV, which has nothing to do with VW.     As the Government had forked out a huge sum, the eager minister was confident that the state had managed to get a major manufacturing sector company.  But Volkswagen did not oblige. After a two-day study of the site at Visakhapatnam in May, a nine-member team led by Schuster went back to Germany, promising to take up the issue at the meeting of the company's board on June 20.  Satyanarayana and the officials gave Schuster a draft MoU to be presented at the meeting. But Volkswagen sacked Schuster five days earlier on June 15 for allegedly taking bribes from the company's suppliers.  Whatever be the minister's role, the scandal has prompted Volkswagen to put on hold the its plans for India. The con tricksters may want everyone to believe that VW stands for Vashishta Wahan, but the bosses at the VW headquarters in Wolfsburg do not agree.       
   Volkswagen itself a bid scam car manufacturer. USA sales largely affected by defeat device tactics.    D

   Singapore varsity ranks Andhra Pradesh No 1 in Ease of Doing Business, Maharashtra 2nd      The Singapore institute also suggested areas where improvement was needed in the state. The report mentioned that despite Andhra Pradesh's excellent performance in ACI's EDB Index, the government needs to bridge numerous institutional and infrastructural gaps in order to sustain its position in the future.              Ashish Pandey    Hyderabad   January 3, 2019   UPDATED: January 3, 2019 23:05 IST                                            Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu. (File Photo: PTI)      HIGHLIGHTS     International investors look for a stable government and leadership: CM   We have to reach the expectations of foreign investors: CM   Andhra Pradesh needs 14 million smartphones meant for distribution for ease of living              Andhra Pradesh has topped the Ease of Doing Business (EDB) list compiled by a team of researchers led by Tan Khee Giap, who is the co-director of Asia competitiveness institute (ACI), and associate professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore.    Andhra is followed by Maharashtra and Delhi.         In the latest ranking of Asia Competitiveness Institute's (ACI) EDB index, Andhra Pradesh bagged the top rank in 2018.    Expressing delight over the announcement, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu said, "International investors look for a stable government with strong policies before coming forward for investments. The state government would take into consideration the observations including weaknesses and try to strengthen those areas."    The chief minister also announced that his government was planning to distribute smartphones to each family for ease of living.    "Nearly 14 million smartphones should be manufactured for distribution in the state," Naidu said.    The Singapore institute also suggested areas where improvement was needed in the state. The report mentioned that despite Andhra Pradesh's excellent performance in ACI's EDB Index, the government needs to bridge numerous institutional and infrastructural gaps in order to sustain its position in the future.    The ACI team highlighted that there was sufficient room for improvement in sub environments such as facilitating business operations, infrastructure resilience and market potential.    Worker density, foreign direct investment per capital, labour productivity, and illiteracy rate were identified as the weakest indicators for the state among others.    The ACI team also emphasised that an analysis at the indicator level will help identify specific areas of improvement and will play a crucial role in making Andhra Pradesh the best investment destination by 2050.    Asia Competitiveness Institute at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore was established as a research centre in 2006 with an aim to build intellectual leadership and network for understanding and developing competitiveness in the Asia region.         https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/andhra-pradesh-ranks-1-in-ease-of-doing-business-maharashtra-second-1423040-2019-01-03

   Tearful Tendulkar Among Those in Attendance as Achrekar Cremated in Mumbai        Mumbai: Renowned cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar, who died due to age-related ailments, was cremated on Thursday with his most famous ward Sachin Tendulkar in attendance for a tearful adieu.                Achrekar, the childhood coach of Tendulkar, passed away at 87 on Wednesday at his Shivaji Park residence in Dadar in Central Mumbai.                 His body was kept at Shivaji Park, where he coached aspiring cricketers, and then taken to a nearby crematorium. When the body was taken outside the ground, young boys, who practice there, gave a guard of honour amid chants of 'Amar Rahe'.    Tendulkar, along with Achrekar's other wards like Vinod Kambli, Balwinder Singh Sandhu and Chandrakant Pandit, took part in the procession to the crematorium, where his body was consigned to flames.  Earlier, the body was kept at his residence for people to pay their last respects to the Dronacharya and Padma Shri award-winning coach.  Mumbai cricketers such as Atul Ranade, Amol Mazumdar Ramesh Powar, Paras Mhambrey, Ranji coach Vinayak Samant, Nilesh Kulkarni, Vinod Raghvan, were also there along with fans.  Former Rajasthan coach Pradeep Sundaram, office-bearers of the Mumbai Cricket Association, veteran cricket administrator Prof. Ratnakar Shetty also paid their last respects.  Among politicians, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, MLA and BJP leader Ashish Shelar, Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar also paid tributes to the decorated coach.

CHP Headquarters reported on Wednesday the number of deaths and DUI arrests that were made during the 102-hour New Year's Maximum Enforcement Period.     Between Dec. 28 and New Year's Day, CHP says that at least 50 people lost their lives in collisions across California.          In a Twitter post, CHP said:      In addition, CHP reported more than 1,140 arrests were made for people driving under the influence.    Officials remind drivers to buckle up and drink responsibly.             At least 50 people were killed in collisions in California throughout the New Year's Maximum Enforcement Period. Sadly, nearly half (47%) of all the vehicle occupants who died within CHP jurisdiction were not wearing a seat belt. Reduce risk of death and serious injury, #BuckleUp  ‚Äî CHP Headquarters (@CHP_HQ) January 2, 2019

                               Amaravati: Even as the state is reeling under water stress and drinking water scarcity, a picture of Naidu and Lokesh enjoying the privilege of expensive Mineral Water brand took social media by storm.     It is learnt that the expensive brand is for Naidu and Lokesh alone and all other party leaders including senior Ministers will be given water bottle from a low cost mineral water brand.       This exclusivity by Chief Minister and his son and IT Minister Lokesh are being questioned by netizens.
