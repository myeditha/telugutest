   This was a great and Matured interview, I have ever seen in the last 5 days. üëå     
        Tesla breaks ground on Shanghai factory which will produce Model 3 EVs for China              Tesla  CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that the company‚Äôs first overseas factory in Shanghai will focus on producing Model 3 vehicles for the Chinese market only.    Musk is currently in China to break ground on the new factory today, which is being developed in partnership with the Shanghai government ‚Äî an ally that is likely to be incredibly useful. The deal was announced by Tesla in July and it was followed quickly by the opening of Model 3 pre-orders for China-based customers in November.    Initial construction of the Shanghai factory is set to be completed by the summer, according to Musk, who said that he expects production to begin before the end of this year. The facility is aimed at churning out 500,000 EVs a year when it reaches full production, which should happen during next year, all being well.    Update: Tesla has clarified that there is no target date for the factory becoming fully operational. Musk‚Äôs tweet, which we took the information from, in fact means ‚Äúhigh volume production‚Äù not full production.             https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/tesla-shanghai-china-model-3

   Guys, I have a question and can someone give inputs for my situation.    Naa old mesthri naa H1B revoke chessadu in the month of November and USCIS online status prakaram revoke ayyindhi Feb 8th. I initiated H1b transfer in the month November itself but because of current time line,,,my transfer is still pending...ippudu time bagha ledu kada...per suppose any denial vasthe options emi untayee....work chestunna and client patram kuda submit chessa but little worried as new employer history of filing with in house projects and has red flag with USCIS..options emi untayee in case of denial..jokes vaddu bhayya..only serious suggestions plz...     
     since your old one is gone in feb this year, and before that you already started new application so you are still in status as of now.    once this application get denied you will go into out of status immediately as you should leave country immediately. but some people say you have 10 days grace period which I don't think mentioned particular in any USCIS policy.    You should be ready with new employer to apply new h1b transfer immediately as soon as you hear about denial from second employer. and approval will depend on your luck and some times you get approval with out i94 since you went out of status of 2-3 weeks before you applied with 3 employer..               
     I haven't activated yet. I m not sure.

    January 7th, 2019 / 6:11 PM / Updated 2 hours ago          Image Source: Zee News      In order to cut costs and rationalise services, Prasar Bharati has decided to shut down All India Radio‚Äôs national channel and its regional training academies will be closed down by Public broadcaster Prasar Bharati in five cities.        View image on Twitter                       See GEORGE KALLIVAYALIL's other Tweets            Twitter Ads info and privacy                            According to an order issued by the Directorate General, All India Radio (AIR), the ministerial, technical, programme and other staff posted at AIR in Nagpur, Todapur and other places are likely to be posted according to the requirement of the organisation. The order also said that this would not include those who are working in five cities at Regional Academies of Broadcasting and Multimedia (RABMs), reported NDTV.     AIR to be shut down to cut costs    On December 24, 2018, Prasar Bharati had decided and communicated to DG AIR to close down the channel with immediate effect and close Regional Academies of Broadcasting and Multimedia located at Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Shillong and Thiruvananthapuram to ‚Äúrationalise AIR services and keeping in view of the cost-cutting measures.‚Äù      Dated January 3, the order stated that the programmes of archival value that the national channel maintains have to be sent to Delhi‚Äôs central archives for digitization and preservation for successors. Naturally, certain sections within AIR itself are not pleased with the decision, as they believe that instead of shutting it down altogether, other methods to cut costs could have been thought about.    ‚ÄúThese days you can live stream, you can make it an application-based service, there are many other ways of cost-cutting. The effort should have been to strengthen national channel and not close it down,‚Äù a source said.    An AIR source said that the channel, which runs from 6 AM to 6 PM is one of the most popular national channels which kept people updated on social issues. It reaches almost 92% of the area of the country, according to AIR‚Äôs website. The largest network of radio in the world, it is also one of the world‚Äôs largest broadcasting organisations, serving a spectrum of socio-economic and cultural diversity.    AIR or officially known as Akash Vani since 1956 is a sister organisation of Doordarshan and was launched in 1936. The first ever FM service was started in Madras (Chennai) in the year 1977. Rajni S K Dutta, a presenter who made the first announcement on May 18, 1988, told Economic Times, ‚ÄúIt was primarily intended for students and those who worked night shifts.‚Äù With the closure of AIR, it is truly an end of an era.

   Kauravas were test tube babies, Ravana had several airports in Lanka: Andhra University VC    Kuravas were born due to stem cell and test tube technologies and India also possessed knowledge about guided missiles thousands of years ago, claimed Andhra University VC G Nageshwar Rao at the Indian Science Congress on Friday.    Rao said Lord Rama used 'astras' and 'shastras' (weapons), while Lord Vishnu sent a Sudardhan Chakra to chase targets. After hitting them they would come back, he said.    This shows that the science of guided missiles is not new to India and it was present thousands of years ago, the VP said.

   The govt has done it gradually stop the high denomination note's circulation        The government of India has stopped printing Rs 2,000 currency notes in order to gradually stop their circulation, ThePrint reported.    According to The Print, the decision has been taken on the back of suspicion in the government that the currency note was being used for hoarding, tax evasion and money laundering.  The Rs 2,000 note was introduced in November 2016 after demonetisation. To counter the massive cash shortage, the government introduced new Rs 2,000 notes.    As of March 2018, the total value of the currency in circulation was Rs 18.03 trillion, of which Rs 6.73 trillion, or 37 per cent, was in Rs 2,000 notes, and Rs 7.73 trillion, approximately 43 per cent, in Rs 500 notes. The remaining was in the lower denominations.    When the Rs 2,000 note was introduced, the Narendra Modi government was criticised for bringing out a note of such a high denomination considering it had cancelled the Rs 1,000 note. Its introduction was criticised as it went against one of the stated objectives of demonetisation, which was to prevent hoarding of black money through high denomination notes.

You might read articles that you don't need visa for cruise to Bahamas etc which means you don't have to take visa of foreign country but you need stamped USA visa to come back.

   'A Lion at Shivaji Park'     It's an anecdote which sums up Ramakant Achrekar, who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 87, the best.                So excited was the man upon seeing a talented youngster play tennis-ball cricket in Chembur that he landed at his house past midnight. The idea was to convince the boy's reluctant father to change his son's school so that he could focus on cricket. Realising that the father was adamant that his son would be better off studying well and taking up a job to support his middle-class family, Achrekar did something which left the father stunned and embarrassed at the same time.                "It's difficult to believe, but sir took out Rs. 1000 from his pocket - which in 1978 was a big amount - and told my father: 'This will be his monthly salary from today.' It was embarrassing for my father to say 'yes' to him! That's how my long cricket career began," recollected former India stumper Chandrakant Pandit, while fighting his emotions as he spoke to TOI about the most loved coach on the cricket maidans of Mumbai.                The news of Achrekar's demise saw a pall of gloom descend on Mumbai's cricket community. Even as they rushed to have a last glimpse of their beloved 'sir', several of his students, who went on to play for Mumbai, India, or at least bagged a job because of the cricket skills that he had imparted, paid rich tributes to a man who played a much bigger role in their life than just being a cricket coach.                "Personally, it's a big loss for me. He made me the person I am. He taught me how to deal with hard times on and off the field. His love for the game was real," said ex-India batsman-turned coach Pravin Amre.                "The service he has given to not only Mumbai cricket but to even world cricket is unparalleled. I hope Sachin (Tendulkar) takes it well," said Sandeep Patil.                "All his memories are flashing in front of me...of sir walking in to Shivaji Park. It was only about seven-eight days back when I was telling my wife and daughter that his presence at Shivaji Park was like that of a lion. It's a big loss for Mumbai and Indian cricket," said former Mumbai stalwart Amol Muzumdar.                "He was like a father-figure and mentor to me. He was the one who spotted my talent. I never played inter-school cricket - Harris or Giles Shield. I just went to a summer vacation camp in RCF, since I stayed in BARC which was nearby. He picked me up there, and then he was after me to change my school. When I was in standard XI, he got me admission in Ruia College," said former India opener and coach Lalchand Rajput.                "I started my journey under Achrekar sir. I owe everything to him. He instilled one value in me early on: 'you need to practise, and you need to work hard'. He made sure that in our initial years we practised and played a lot of matches. That laid a solid foundation for us to build our cricket on," remembered former India pacer Paras Mhambrey, currently the India A bowling coach.                "He is responsible for making the lives of so many cricketers, a cause for which he spent his entire life. And he had no 'selfish interest' behind it! I had no clue that I had any talent or potential. He gave a direction to our careers. It's not just that he produced Test or Ranji cricketers - but he helped people get jobs because of cricket. And that helped those people support their families. He's played a huge role in everyone's career," praised former India seamer Balwinder Singh Sandhu.    SOME FAMOUS ACHREKAR ANECDOTES          When Tendulkar and Kambli got a dressing down                The Test versus England in February 1993 at Wankhede is remembered for India inflicting an innings defeat that sealed the 3-0 whitewash. But what it is also famous for is the fact that the city's most fertile cricketing stable, Shardashram Vidyamandir, had three of its ex-students, in the playing XI. Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli and Amre. However, as the cameras looked for Achrekar in the crowd, that search proved to be futile. Achrekar was at the Cross Maidan as both his schools, Shardashram English and Marathi, were contesting the final of the Harris shield.                However, he was still up to date with the proceedings across the street and saw a few overs where he witnessed Tendulkar getting out for 78 and Kambli fishing at wide deliveries from Chris Lewis and Paul Jarvis. Both were summoned to the Cross Maidan and were given a dressing down. Achrekar asked Kambli, "Don't you know where your off-stump is?". The lecture helped Kambli as he went on to score 224 on Day 4.                The coins of motivation                At the Shardashram nets, when dusk almost married the evening, Achrekar used to give his favourite ward, Sachin Tendulkar, a new challenge. In fading light, after the 13-year-old was exhausted facing bowlers for almost an hour, he used to place a one rupee coin on top of the off-stump and tell the bowlers, I will give it to anyone who gets Sachin out. It was a challenge that most bowlers failed and the proof of that is the number of those coins that Sachin has in his treasure. That they still occupy pride of place in his opulent trophy cabinet, shows how stiff the challenge was and how expertly Tendulkar dealt with it.                Slap after a triple ton                Chandrakant Pandit scored a triple hundred in his very first match for Shardashram, and that too on the opening day of the game. However, Pandit was out after hitting the ball in the air. As soon as he came back, he was expecting that 'sir' would give him a pat on the back. However, Achrekar slapped him hard, leaving Pandit a little shocked. The boy realised his mistake when Achrekar told him that he could have batted on. Later, he slapped Pandit again, when he was caught brilliantly at covers while driving the ball, in a friendly game. Achrekar was upset with Pandit that he gave that chance to the fielder. He didn't want his students to come up with any excuses.

             As you arrive in Times Square, the police will start setting up viewing sections with barricades.  Once you are in a section, you might be able to leave until the ball has dropped.  Which then leads to the next paragraph.     Let's discuss where to go, when you have to go.  Most hotels, restaurants and stores surrounding the viewing area will not allow you to use their rest rooms.  Unfortunately, there are no paid toilets or port-a-potties. For some, wearing  Adult Diapers, Adult Briefs,Protective Underwear or Pull Ups is an option.  If you decide to "go" in public, you will be arrested!

     Arjun reddy has cult following. I am not saying it is a bad movie. It is a good movie. For that fact badri and kushi should be in top 5. It was a greatest trend setter for their time . But as time passes they are valued as good trend setter movies rather than great movies of all time     
   I would replace rudraveena with apad andavydu         Will remove dhruva and oopiri from the list

     No reservations at all. Not on economic grounds or anything. There should be no reservations at all.     It should be equal opportunity to every indian regardless of gender, race, religion, caste, color, or any thing.     Fight for equal opportunities for everyone if you want to see a better country.

Vp Singh and then chandrasekhar are the prime ministers during that time period supported by Congress led by Rajiv Gandhi. All the policy decisions are taken only with Rajiv's approval. Govt appudu Chala weak. According to kcr, I think during that time period, IBM came up with this proposal and Rajiv asked AP cm to take care of it.
